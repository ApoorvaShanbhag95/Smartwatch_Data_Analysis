# Smartwatch Data Analysis

An exploratory analysis of fitness/activity data collected from Fitbit smartwatches. The aim is to understand daily activity patterns, energetic output (like calories burned), and periods of higher/lower activity, using real-world data.

---

## 📋 Objectives

- Explore daily activity levels: steps, active minutes, calories burned.  
- Identify which days of the week tend to be most/least active.  
- Understand user behavior: how consistent or varied are activity levels across days.  
- Visualize and summarize the data to spot patterns, peaks, troughs.  
- Draw actionable insights: e.g. when interventions (fitness nudges, rest days) might be helpful.

## 🧰 Dataset & Tools

- **Dataset**: Fitbit activity data for 30 female users.  
  Source: `dailyActivity_merged.csv` (Kaggle) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Tools**:  
  - Jupyter Notebook for analysis & visualization (`.ipynb`)  
  - Python data libraries (likely Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn or similar)  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights / Sample Findings

- **Tuesday** is among the most active days: users tend to burn the most calories on Tuesdays. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Thursday** is among the least active days. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Additional findings might include patterns in steps, active minutes, or how activity correlates with other variables (if included in the dataset).

## 🚀 Value / Possible Applications

- Helps users or health apps understand which days people are more or less active; useful for scheduling workouts, rest days, etc.  
- Could inform personalized reminders or nudges (e.g. suggest more activity on less active days).  
- Useful for health researchers looking into daily activity rhythms.  
- Basis for further modelling: predictions (e.g. expected activity on given day), anomaly detection, trend changes, etc.
