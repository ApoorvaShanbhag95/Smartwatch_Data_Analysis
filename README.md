Smartwatches are preferred by people who like to take care of their fitness. Analyzing the data collected on your fitness is one of the use cases of Data Science in healthcare.
Below is the analysis of data collected on a Smartwatch.

EDA

Below are the observations which we have made from the data visualization done as part of the Data Understanding process.

Tuesday is one of the most active days for all individuals in the dataset, as the highest number of calories were burned on Tuesdays.

Thursday is the most inactive day according to the lifestyle of all the individuals in the dataset.
